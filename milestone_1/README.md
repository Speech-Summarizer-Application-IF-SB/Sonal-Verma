# üöÄ Audio Pre-processing Project

This project provides a simple Python script (`audio_cleaner.py`) to pre-process audio files. It can be used to reduce background noise from existing `.wav` files or to record and clean new audio directly from a microphone.

The script uses several key libraries to handle audio manipulation, including `noisereduce` for noise reduction, `pydub` for high-level audio operations, and `sounddevice` for recording.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

* **Noise Reduction**: Cleans background noise from existing audio files.
* **Live Recording**: Records new audio from a microphone and cleans it on the fly.
* **Simple CLI**: Easy-to-use command-line interface to choose between processing a file or recording.
* **Organized Output**: Saves all processed and recorded files neatly into an `output/` directory.

## üìÇ Project Structure

Ensure your project directory is set up as follows. The sample audio files (e.g., from the NOIZEUS dataset) should be placed at the root of the project folder.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Get Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the audio pre-processing script.

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x**
* **FFmpeg**: The `pydub` library requires FFmpeg. You must install it on your system separately. You can download it from the [official FFmpeg site](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

### 2. Quick Start (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
# 1) Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Speech-Summarizer-Application-IF-SB/Sonal-Verma.git
cd Sonal-Verma

# 2) Create & activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
. .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 3) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4) Navigate to milestone_1
cd milestone_1

# 5) Run the audio cleaner script
python audio_cleaner.py
```

**For macOS/Linux users:**
```bash
# 1) Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Speech-Summarizer-Application-IF-SB/Sonal-Verma.git
cd Sonal-Verma

# 2) Create & activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4) Navigate to milestone_1
cd milestone_1

# 5) Run the audio cleaner script
python audio_cleaner.py
```

### 3. Using the Audio Cleaner

The script will prompt you to choose between cleaning an existing file or recording new audio.

#### To clean an existing audio file:

1.  Choose the **file** option when prompted.
2.  Enter the name of the audio file you wish to clean (e.g., `sp01-train-sn10_OxrSReyA.wav`).
3.  The script will process the file and save a cleaned version in the `output/` folder.

#### To record and clean live audio:

1.  Choose the **live** option when prompted.
2.  Enter the number of seconds you want to record.
3.  The script will save both the raw recording and a cleaned version in the `output/` folder.
